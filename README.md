<p>Develop a deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The model should be able to accurately distinguish between different brain tumor types (i.e., glioma, meningioma, pituitary and no tumor) based on the features present in the MRI scans.</p>
